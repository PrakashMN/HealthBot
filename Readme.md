## 🚀 Getting Started

Thanks to containerization with Docker, getting the project running locally is very simple.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd HealthBot
    ```

3.  **Run the application using Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
    This single command will build the images for the frontend and backend services and start the containers.

4.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:80` (or the port you've configured for the frontend) to see the application running.
